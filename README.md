"I want to create a learning tool using AI. Suggest some project ideas where students can learn quickly in small chunks, like micro-learning."
"From the ideas above, narrow down to one where AI acts as a tutor to generate short lessons and quizzes for learners."
"Design an outline for an AI-powered micro-tutor that can: (1) generate a 5-minute lesson on a given topic, (2) create a quiz, and (3) allow a student to ask follow-up questions."
"Give me a simple system architecture for the AI micro-tutor, showing frontend, backend, and AI integration."
"Write a starter Express.js backend that serves an API and connects to Hugging Face for AI text generation."
"Write a simple frontend (HTML + CSS + JavaScript) that calls my backend to display lessons and quizzes, with a section for AI chat."
"Improve the backend so that errors from Hugging Face (e.g., model not found, auth issues) are handled gracefully and returned as JSON."
"Update the frontend script so that if the AI response is missing, it doesn’t show ‘undefined’ but instead displays a friendly error message."
"Suggest good UI/UX practices for making the AI tutor clear and engaging — for example, how to display lessons, quizzes, and chat in a neat way."
"Now, integrate all the pieces together and give me the clean final code for backend (server.js), frontend (index.html, styles.css, script.js), and environment setup."
